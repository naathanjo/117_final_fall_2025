# Accessibility (a11y) Checklist

Ensure your site is usable by everyone.

- [ ] **Semantic HTML**: Use proper tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<button>` instead of generic `<div>`s where appropriate.
- [ ] **Alt Text**: All images must have descriptive `alt` attributes. Use `alt=""` for decorative images.
- [ ] **Color Contrast**: Text must have sufficient contrast against the background (aim for WCAG AA standard).
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: You should be able to tab through all links and form inputs in a logical order.
- [ ] **Form Labels**: All form inputs must have associated `<label>` tags.
- [ ] **Headings**: Use `<h1>` through `<h6>` in a logical hierarchy (only one `<h1>` per page).
