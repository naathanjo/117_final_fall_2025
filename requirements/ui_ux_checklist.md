# UI/UX Design Checklist

Make sure your site is pleasant and easy to use.

- [ ] **Responsiveness**: The site must look good and function correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- [ ] **Navigation**: The menu should be easy to find and use. On mobile, use a hamburger menu or appropriate mobile pattern.
- [ ] **Typography**: Use a readable font size (base 16px recommended) and limit yourself to 2-3 font families.
- [ ] **Whitespace**: Give your content room to breathe. Avoid clutter.
- [ ] **Call to Action (CTA)**: Your "Book Consultation" or "Contact" buttons should be prominent and easy to click.
- [ ] **404 Page**: Create a custom "Page Not Found" page that guides users back to the home page.
- [ ] **Favicon**: Include a small icon that appears in the browser tab.
